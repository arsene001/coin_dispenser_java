"# coin_dispenser_java" 

This is the back end built in with Java 8.

Please open the project with IntelliJ and set project language level to lambda since I used java8 lambda.

Go to Main.java and run the file from its main function.

The back end service is socket based and multithreaded.

There are 2 users saved in a file(users.txt) under resources. These users can be used to login and test the functionality from the front end.
